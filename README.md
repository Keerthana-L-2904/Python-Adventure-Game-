A interactive game using pycharm 
Modules Used:
1. pygame: Used throughout the project for handling game graphics (loading images, blitting), managing game loop (CLOCK.tick, event handling), and integrating game components (SuperBoy, Monster, Fireball).
2. sys: The sys module provides access to system-specific parameters and functions. It's used for system exit (sys.exit()) in the game loop to gracefully quit the game when needed.
3. tkinter: Used to create a simple GUI interface when the game ends, displaying the final score, top score, and providing options to play again or quit.
4. pygame.mixer: Used to load and play background music (music.mp3) during the game and play sound effects (died.wav) when the game ends.

Tech Stack Used:
1. Python
2. DSA
