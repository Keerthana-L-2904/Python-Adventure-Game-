A interactive game using pycharm 
Modules Used:
		1.	pygame
				o	Purpose: pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It provides functionalities for handling graphics, sound, input devices, and more, making it suitable for game development.
				o	Usage: Used throughout the project for handling game graphics (loading images, blitting), managing game loop (CLOCK.tick, event handling), and integrating game components (SuperBoy, Monster, Fireball).
		2.	sys
				o	Purpose: The sys module provides access to system-specific parameters and functions. It's used for system exit (sys.exit()) in the game loop to gracefully quit the game when needed.
		3.	tkinter
				o	Purpose: tkinter is Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit. It's used for creating the game over screen with buttons to play again or quit the game.
				o	Usage: Used to create a simple GUI interface when the game ends, displaying the final score, top score, and providing options to play again or quit.
		4.	pygame.mixer
				o	Purpose: The pygame.mixer module provides functions for loading and playing sounds in pygame games.
				o	Usage: Used to load and play background music (music.mp3) during the game and play sound effects (died.wav) when the game ends.

Tech Stack Used:
		1.	Python
				o	Purpose: Python is the programming language used for developing the entire game.
				o	Usage: Used for implementing game logic, handling game mechanics (movement, collision detection), managing scores and levels, and integrating different game components.
		2.	pygame
				o	Purpose: pygame is used as the primary game development framework in Python.
				o	Usage: Provides essential functionalities such as handling graphics (loading images, rendering), game loop management (CLOCK.tick), event handling (keyboard inputs), and integrating game objects (SuperBoy, Monster, Fireball).
		3.	tkinter
				o	Purpose: tkinter is used for creating the game over screen with a simple GUI interface.
				o	Usage: Displays the final score and top score, and provides buttons for users to play again or quit the game.
